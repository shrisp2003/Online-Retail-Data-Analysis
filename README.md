# Online-Retail-Data-Analysis
The Online Retail Data Analysis project focuses on studying the sales data of a UK-based online store. The goal is to find out which products are selling the most, which countries bring the highest sales, and how sales change over time. The project involves steps like collecting the data, cleaning it by removing errors and missing values.
